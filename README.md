# Strategic-Investment-Analysis-
Identifying market leaders in the global cloud services sector and  modeling the volatility of their stock returns to drive investment  strategic decisions.

Executive Summary:

This report investigates the intersection of cloud computing market
leadership and financial risk modeling to guide strategic investment
decisions. It begins by identifying Amazon Web Services (AWS) and
Microsoft Azure as dominant global cloud providers, supported by
infrastructure breadth, service innovation, and competitive market
share. Modeling the volatility of stock returns is crucial for modern
finance, moving beyond historical observations to provide a dynamic
understanding of risk. This approach offers benefits such as enhanced
risk management, optimized portfolio construction, improved
derivatives pricing, informed trading strategy development, and better
performance evaluation. The expected outcomes of this report include
identifying Amazon and Microsoft as the dominant players, profiling
their competitive advantages (e.g., AWS's broad services and global
infrastructure, and Microsoft's enterprise integration and AI
investments ), and applying statistical models to analyze the volatility of
their daily stock returns.
